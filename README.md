# $${\color{green}Service Registry:-}$$  
Service registry looks like a centralized database or directory where all information about registered service stored.
service registry contains the information about service and their location is stored and maintained.
Service Registry serves as a central hub for managing service discovery and communication in a microservices architecture. 
## How service registry works :- 
### 1. Service Registration
>When we create a service then we can register that service into service registry.
>In service registration process we need to include metadata such as Service name, Network location, health status and others 
### 2. Service Lookup
>if client and other microservice want to communicate with particular service , 
>in this case client and other microservice do not have idea about the location of that service and other info regarding to the required service.
>So here service registry contains such kind of information regarding all registered services.
### 3. Health Monitoring
>Service registry also perform health checkup machanism to monitored the status of registered service instance. 
>service registry removes unhealthy and unavailable services to ensure that client only receive informatio about healthy and operational service.
### 4. Load Balancing
>some service registry having capability to handle load balancing.
>distribute incomming request among multiple instance of same service. this helps optimize resource utiliztion, improving performance, and enhancing fault taularance.


# $${\color{green}API Gateway:-}$$ 
>An API gateway accept request from client, process them based on defined policy and direct them to the appropriate service.
>It acts as middle man between the client and groups of microservice.
>API Gateway encapsulates internal system architecture.
>It also has other responsibilities such as authentication, monitoring, load balancing, caching, request shaping and management, and static response handling.
>API Gateway is a service that sits between clients and backend services.
>it serves as a single entry point for clients to access multiple services, providing a unified interface and abstracting the complexities of the underlying architecture
###  How does API Gateway Works
>API gateway acts as single entry point for client and client can communicate with multiple services using the single entry point.
>API Gateway abstracting the underline artitecture and provide unified interface for client.
### 1. Routing 
>when a client send request to API Gateway, API Gateway will identify which microservice will serve the commig request.
>This routing can be based on various criteria such as the URL path, HTTP method, or headers.
### 2. Protocol Translation
>API Gateway has capability to translate request from one protocol to another.
>It can accept http request from client and convert then gRPC and websocket request for backend service.
### 3. Authentication and Authorization 
>API gateway can handle Authentication and authorization for incomming request.it can check the necesarray permission to access the request.
### 3. Set the rate limit
### 4. Load Balancing 
>The API Gateway can distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of a service to ensure high availability and scalability.
### 5. Caching 
>To improve performance, the API Gateway can cache responses from backend services and serve them directly to clients for subsequent identical requests.
### 5. Monitoring and loging 
>The API Gateway can collect metrics and logs for incoming requests, providing insights into the usage and performance of the system
# $${\color{red} Challenges Using API Gateway:-}$$:-
we can face following chalangages into API Gateway 
### 1. Performance bottlenecks:-
> As we know API gateay provide single entry point to client so we need to configure it very carefully so that it can handle the load.
### 2. Security :-
> Misconfiguration API can lead security vulranibility risk such as improper authentication, authorization, or exposure of sensitive information
> Regular security audits and updates are essential to mitigate these risks.
### 3. Monitoring and logging :-
>Monitoring and logging the API Gatewayâ€™s performance and behavior can be complex, especially when dealing with a large number of requests and services
### 3. Complexity :-
> Managing and configuring an API Gateway can be complex, especially in environments with a large number of services and endpoints
> Proper documentation and automation tools can help reduce this complexity.
