# service Registry:-  
service registry contains the information about service and their location is stored and maintained.
## How service registry works :- 
### 1. Service Registration
When we create a service then we can register that service into service registry.
In service registration process we need to include metadata such as Service name, Network location, health status and others 
### 2. Service Lookup
if client and other microservice want to communicate with particular service , 
in this case client and other microservice do not have idea about the location of that service and other info regarding to the required service.
So here service registry contains such kind of information regarding all registered services.
### 3. Health Monitoring
